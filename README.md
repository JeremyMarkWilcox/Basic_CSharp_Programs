# Basic_C-_Programs
 A repository for all of my C# work in Bootcamp

 ## [TwentyOneExercise](TwentyOneExercise)


## TwentyOne Card Project

In this project I covered a large number of aspects of C#. Enough to create a functioning cardgame. Looking forward to creating my own games and designs.


There is a long list of C# exercises in my repository. They are labeled well for the subjects that they cover.
