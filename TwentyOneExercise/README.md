## TwentyOne Card Project

In this project I covered a large number of aspects of C#. Enough to create a functioning cardgame. Looking forward to creating my own games and designs.

# In the debugging I added the following:

* I created a function to parse the user's extra strings in their money, especially the "$' symbol in particular.

* Fixed a bug where the user was prompted to retype an amount that the user actually possessed. Previously it printed it 3 times.

* Fixed spacing in the display some
